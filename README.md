## 🚀 Python Libraries and Frameworks

I also have extensive experience with the following Python libraries and frameworks, crucial for data science, machine learning, and web development:

- **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Key for high-performance numerical computing.
- **Keras**: Powerful for building and training deep learning models.
- **PyTorch**: Flexible and powerful tool for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- **PyTorch Geometric**: Specialized for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for numerical computation and machine learning that can scale from single CPU/GPU to clusters.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Effective for web scraping tasks, making it easy to parse HTML and XML documents.
- **Django & Flask**: Robust frameworks for building high-quality web applications; Django provides a high level of abstraction, while Flask offers simplicity and flexibility.
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

and more much.

These tools are integral to my daily work, enabling efficient data processing, statistical analysis, model development, and robust web service creation.
